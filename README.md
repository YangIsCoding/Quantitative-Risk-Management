## Introduction
This repository documents my journey and projects undertaken in a Quantitative Risk Management course. It emphasizes the application of statistical methods for managing market risks in single assets and portfolios, including those comprising options and stocks.

## [Weekly Projects]
Each week of the course focused on a distinct aspect of risk management, culminating in a project that applied theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.

### Week 2: Bias, Model Fitting, and Time Series Simulation
- **Description**: Explored bias in skewness and kurtosis estimators, data fitting with OLS and MLE, and simulating AR and MA processes.
- **Key Learnings**: Gained insights into statistical data fitting and time series model behavior.

### Week 3: Exponentially Weighted Covariance Matrix and PCA
- **Description**: Computed exponentially weighted covariance matrices for stock returns, analyzed using PCA.
- **Key Learnings**: Understood the impact of lambda values on the covariance matrix and data representation.

### Week 4: Price Simulations and VaR Calculations
- **Description**: Simulated price returns using various models and calculated VaR.
- **Key Learnings**: Deepened knowledge of price simulation models and VaR calculation methods.

### Week 5: Fitting Distributions and Risk Metrics
- **Description**: Fitted Normal and Generalized T distributions to data; calculated VaR and ES.
- **Key Learnings**: Learned the importance of distribution fitting in risk assessment.

### Week 6: Option Valuation and Portfolio Strategies
- **Description**: Analyzed call and put options under different implied volatilities; explored portfolio strategies.
- **Key Learnings**: Gained practical experience in option valuation and strategy development.

### Week 7: Advanced Options Analysis and Portfolio Optimization
- **Description**: Implemented advanced options analysis techniques; developed a portfolio using the Fama-French 3 factor model.
- **Key Learnings**: Enhanced understanding of options Greeks and portfolio optimization.

### Week 8: Risk and Return Attribution
- **Description**: Focused on risk and return attribution in portfolio management; covered advanced topics like risk budgeting.
- **Key Learnings**: Gained comprehensive insights into risk and return attribution in portfolios.

## [Self-Made Risk Analysis Packages](https://github.com/QijunYang1/Quantitative-Risk-Management/tree/main/MyRiskPackage)

This suite of Python scripts demonstrates a range of functionalities from basic financial calculations to advanced risk assessments.

### Python Scripts
- **CalculateReturn.py**: Methods for calculating financial returns.
- **CovarianceEstimation.py**: EWMA Covariance and Correlation Matrix calculation.
- **ModelFitter.py**: Fitting Normal and Generalized T Distributions.
- **NonPsdFixes.py**: Handling non-positive semi-definite matrices.
- **PortfolioOptimization.py**: Super-efficient portfolio optimization.
- **RiskMetrics.py**: Variety of risk metrics calculations.
- **SimulationMethods.py**: Simulating asset prices and returns.
- **Options.py**: Options pricing and Greeks calculations.

### Use Cases ([Use_case.ipynb](https://github.com/QijunYang1/Quantitative-Risk-Management/blob/main/MyRiskPackage/Use_case.ipynb))
This notebook demonstrates the practical application of the package, including portfolio optimization, risk assessment, financial data simulations, and options analysis.

## Technologies Used
This repository extensively uses Python and its libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis, financial modeling, and visualization.

## How to Use This Repository
- **Weekly Projects**: Detailed insights into each week's focus area.
